# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on a set of input features.

# Introduction

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze a set of features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

# Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/kyofie/Heart-Disease-Prediction
Navigate to the project directory: cd Heart-Disease-Prediction

# Data

The heart disease prediction model requires a labeled dataset for training. The dataset should contain records of individuals along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Prepare your input data in a CSV file with appropriate columns and values.
Update the file path in the code to point to your input data.
The data is understood using correlation matrix and histograms.

A sample dataset is provided in the data directory (dataset.csv). 

# Model Development

The heart disease prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm, such as K Neighbors Classifier, support vector classifier, decision tree classifier, or random forest classifier.
