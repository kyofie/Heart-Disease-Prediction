# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on a set of input features.

# Introduction

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze a set of features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

# Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/kyofie/Heart-Disease-Prediction
Navigate to the project directory: cd Heart-Disease-Prediction

# Usage

Prepare your input data in a CSV file with appropriate columns and values.
Update the file path in the code to point to your input data.
Run the prediction script: Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb
The program will output the predicted heart disease probabilities for each record in your input data.
Please note that the model should be trained and saved before using the Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb script. Refer to the following sections for details on model development and evaluation.

# Data

The heart disease prediction model requires a labeled dataset for training. The dataset should contain records of individuals along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

A sample dataset is provided in the data directory (dataset.csv). Feel free to use this dataset or replace it with your own dataset. Ensure that your dataset is in a CSV format and has the required columns.

# Model Development

The heart disease prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm, such as K Neighbors Classifier, support vector classifier, decision tree classifier, or random forest classifier.

To develop your own model, follow these steps:

Prepare your labeled dataset as described in the Data section.
Split your dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose a machine learning algorithm and import the necessary libraries.
Train the model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.
Fine-tune the model parameters to improve its accuracy if necessary.
Save the trained model for future use.
